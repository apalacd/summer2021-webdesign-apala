        <h1>My Hobby Project</h1>

        <p>Hi, I am Apala! I have many hobbies including creating new, useful items with recyclables, creative art and sculpting with biodegradable materials, making healthy simulated non-vegetarian dishes with vegetarian ingredients, plant propagation, music, yoga, gardening, traveling, reading, photography, learning new skills and moreâ€¦ In fact, I fall short of time in pursuing them all at once and take on only one or two of my hobbies and the related projects at a time to be able to finish them.  For this assignment project, I will share about one of my many hobbies - Creating new and purposeful items with recyclable materials. I challenge myself to come up with new creative ways to renew plastic containers and glass bottles. I like to put them to a good use as and when I can. harming our environment and nature. </p>

        <p>In todays world, there are many items whether consumable or not, are packaged in plastic containers and glass bottles. As a result, a lot of recyclable plastic and glass ends up in the landfill if not reused or repurposed. According to some studies, it takes a plastic and glass bottles anywhere from 10 to 100 years to decompose [Credit: <a href="https://thisisplastics.com/environment/things-you-might-not-know-about-landfills/)" target="_blank">thisplastics.com</a>]. Plastic buried deep in landfills can leach harmful chemicals that spread into the groundwater hence harming our environment and nature. With the recent pandemic, even more of plastics and glass has made it to the landfills. As a responsible human, it becomes our responsibility to try and reduce this waste as much as possible by renewing, reusing and repurposing these materials.
