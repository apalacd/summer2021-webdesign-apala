<p>Opinion : I found the format of this book quite interesting. It provides 
a roadmap from learning the basics to the core skills like adding images
and video and laying out the page, plus learning typography, responsive
design, and the other tools of the web trade. All these are organically
woven into the project based lessons making it easier to learn by following
along. However, one thing is that the author has not provided any additional
mini-code challenges based on certain concepts on HTML/CSS.</p>

<p>Opinion : I like the framework of this book as it follows a problem-solution approach. Solution to every problem is expressed as the javascript code and then explained the what, how and why’s of the solution code. 
I did not like that the author has written this book probably with an assumption that the reader is already familiar with the concepts of javascript but hasn’t mentioned it as such.</p>
