# Homework4-1

For this homework, you will create image and collect images that will help your reader guide them through your instructions for your hobby.

* During the second paragraph of your hobby page you should have explained how to get started with your hobby and have provided instructions, possibly as a list. Read through your instructions and decide how an image can help you describe that step. Take at a minimum, three images with your camera, smartphone, or webcam. If you do not have these, please borrow one from your family or friends for this assignment. Keep the following tips in mind:
* Create **three** clear and sharp photos. When you press the shutter button, you move the device and can potentially create a blurry photo. Use the timer function if your device has it, that way you have a few seconds to focus on not moving the device while it's taking the photo.
	* "Zoom" into your photos and make sure that the small details are not blurry, retake your photos if they are. Some older or budget devices will generally have blurry results because of the sensor, do your best in minimizing blur.
	* Putting your arm that's holding the device on something solid can help with reducing blur.
	* Think about the angle of the photo. Test if having the photo at a lower angle improves visualizing the subject.
	* Example photos can be: A collection of starting tools and materials, completed projects or ones that are in progress, showing a complex process through a single photo or set of photos.
* You will also be searching for three images on the Internet to be used on your hobby web page. When searching for these images you will need to pay special attention to the **license** of that image. You cannot just take an image and provide credits, you need written permission to use every image that is not yours. Image licenses can count as written permission based on what the license states.
* Read the Copyright section (up to the Public Domain subsection) from [The Ultimate Guide to Image Usage Rights](https://getcarro.com/blog/the-ultimate-guide-to-image-usage-rights/) by Sarah Donaworth to get a basic idea of copyright.
* Having a basic understanding of copyright, find images that have their licensing and identify if you can use it for free for personal or commercial use. Make sure to save a link to the licensing term for future reference.
* All images on [pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/) and [pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/) have a very open license agreement. Please read the license of these images to get a clear understanding of what you can and cannot do. If you cannot find images that help your hobby page, look for images on other websites.
* Generally you can email or contact the website/photo owner to ask for permission to use an image if there is no image license, but because of the nature of this homework, you may get a response much later than the due date of this homework, so it is recommended against trying to contact the owner for permission.
* Please find **at a minimum, three images** found on the Internet that will help you describe your hobby. Create a file "license.txt" and type in the image file name, and below each image file name, a link to the image license, or file name of the license file.
* Make sure to place all files in a folder called "hobby-images" inside of your project folder.
* Add, commit, and push your repository by **Wednesday 30, 2021 11:59PM**
