# Homework

* Create a [**FreeCodeCamp**](http://www.freecodecamp.org/) account. If you already have a FreeCodeCamp account, feel free to use that one instead.

* Make sure to validate your email with **FreeCodeCamp**, an email is usually sent to your email address to confirm.

* Copy the **URL** of your **profile page**, you can get that URL by clicking on *Menu* and then *Profile* in the top right corner of the website once you are logged in.

* Note: Sometimes your username may end up being a long string of characters and numbers, you can **update your username** by going to *Menu* and then *Settings*. If you updated your username, make sure to use the updated profile page URL to complete this homework.
